I'm a mechanical engineer focused on performance-critical mechanical systems and hardware design. <br />


As Steering & Vehicle Hardware Lead for [Cal Sol](https://calsol.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, I led the end-to-end development of race-critical systems - from design and structural validation through manufacturing and on-vehicle integration.<br />


Previously, I worked at [Ferrari](https://www.ferrari.com/en-US) as a Mechanical Engineering Intern, contributing to vehicle subsystem development within a high-performance automotive environment.<br />


I studied Mechanical Engineering at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://me.berkeley.edu/), graduating magna cum laude.<br />
